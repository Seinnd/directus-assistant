## Disclaimer
### Response Accuracy
While this Directus Chat Assistant Extension leverages the advanced capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4-1106-preview model, it's important to note that the accuracy of responses may vary. The assistant strives to provide relevant and contextually appropriate information based on the input queries and the underlying data schema. However, users should be aware that the responses might not always be entirely precise or exhaustive, and should verify critical information independently.

### Token Consumption
The integration of GPT-4-1106-preview model in this extension involves significant token consumption, primarily due to the comprehensive nature of data schema analysis and query processing. Users should be mindful of the potentially high usage of OpenAI tokens, which could lead to elevated API costs. It's recommended to monitor the token usage regularly and consider optimizing queries for efficiency.
